Although, the runtime of this algorithm is more than the runtime of sorting algorithm, this is a better solution than sorting because this works in O(n) time complexity and with a O(n) Auxiliary Space... Unlike the sorting algorithm, which grants the solution in O(nlogn) time...
The runtime for sorting is better maybe because the input is not as large as it should have been...
