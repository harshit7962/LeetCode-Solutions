this is kinda brute force way to find the solution...
Here for every index in s, we are taking into count every index of y...
and henceforth, we are finding till values, starting from this index of y gives us distance of 1.
â€‹
If the distance is 0, we ignore it...
if the distance is 1, we increment our result..
if the distancce is 2, we break out of the loop... and continue with next j value...
