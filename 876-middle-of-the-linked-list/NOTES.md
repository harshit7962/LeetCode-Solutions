2 Pointer approach...
Here we are moving one pointer at double speed and the next pointer with normal speed.
Hence whenever we are in the traversal, it is for sure that the second pointer will traverse half of the distance instead of full distance...
Clearly, at the end of the traversal of first pointer, second pointer would have covered half of the list..
