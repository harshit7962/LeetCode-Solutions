Here we are taking current result value into account... we know that result value will increase by a multiple of 2 due to its position in linkedlist...
for example if list is 1->0->0... the result value will be 1\*2\*2... this can be guranteed by mutliplying 1 with 2 after every 0...
similary we can track eacch 1 in the linked list... and hence the final result will be---
res\*2+value of node....
